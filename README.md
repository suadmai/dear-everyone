<h1>**@everyone** is a Progressive Web App I developed during my degree as a personal farewell gesture to my close friends.</h1>h1>

Built using **Flutter** and backed by **Firebase** for hosting and data management, the app allows me to share my thoughts and memories with those who were part of my university journey. 

This project marks my first solo full-stack development, combining my passion for **design** and **technology**. It not only showcases my technical abilities but also reflects the meaningful connections I made during my academic career.
